### Were your predictions right?
No, I was completely wrong.

### What surprised you?
What surprised me is how difficult or involved the process of calculating a correlation between values is.

### What was tricky or rewarding?
It was rewarding to see all the functions come together to make a whole picture as individual pieces. Each function relates to another, and you can use them together to do more involved work.

### How did using your own data change things?
Using my own data, I can see how I can write code to actually analyze and help myself and others in practical ways using data.
